During this lecture, we compare two kinds of streams: thunk-based and
continuation-based (generators).

Here is post @1113 on Piazza:

Another kind of lazy evaluation

Hanging on there.

Generators in Python are a very cool and powerful programming feature:

This feature bears a lot of resemblance to the kind of lazy-evaluation
we have been covering. This feature is continuation-based, though. It
happens that the last major concept we introduce and study in this
class is CONTINUATION. So I will go over generators in Python
tomorrow, preparing for the introduction of continuation. Then we are
done!
