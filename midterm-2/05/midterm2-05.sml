A sequence xs of integers captures '231'
if there are three integers a, b, and c
appearing as a subsequence of in satisfying
c < a < b. Note that a, b, and c doe not have
to appear consecutively in xs.

For instance, [1,3,4,2] does capture '231'
For instance, [1,2,4,3] does not capture '231'
For instance, [1,2,3,4] does not capture '231'
